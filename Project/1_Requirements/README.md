# Description
  Infrequently electric fan utilization is dissipated as a result of human behaviour. Humans generally requests something that effortlessly to be utilized without squandering vitality. To minimize or diminish the force use, this venture added to a programmed framework where pace is 
controlled by the room temperature.
  Generally, electronic gadgets create enough heat due to internal loss. There is a necessity to decrease heat to so that electronics devices wonâ€™t lose their characteristic. The heat can be minimized in various methods. One of the method is temperature dependent dc fan implementing microcontroller. When environment temperature sensed by the sensor crosses the threshold value fan is switched on and temperature is reduced. The fan will remain on till the temperature reduces below the threshold value. This general idea is used in this project.
